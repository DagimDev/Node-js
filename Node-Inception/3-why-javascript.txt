WHY JAVASCRIPT WAS CHOSEN
─────────────────────────
1. Perfect Fit:
   - Already async (browser event handling)
   - Massive developer familiarity
   - Lightweight syntax

2. The Missing Piece:
   - No server-side compiler → Solved by V8
   - Ryan Dahl embedded V8 + C++ libs → Node.js

3. Limitations:
   - Single-threaded (bad for CPU-heavy tasks)
   - Not ideal for:
     • Image/video processing
     • Complex calculations
     • Machine learning
