THE PROBLEM NODE.JS SOLVES
───────────────────────────
1. Core Issue:
   - Synchronous architectures waste CPU cycles waiting
   - Thread-per-request models don't scale well

2. Node's Solution:
   - Non-blocking I/O via event loop
   - Single thread handles 1000s of concurrent connections
   - Perfect for I/O-heavy apps (APIs, web servers)
