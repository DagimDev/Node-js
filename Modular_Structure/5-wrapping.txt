Wrapping your code inside braces:
▪ Example:
     (eat = () => {
        console.log("Kebede ate");
     })
     Example:
        (eat = () => {
        console.log("Hana ate");
     });
        eat();// This will print both “Kebede ate”
        and “Hana ate”
● 3. Using the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) way:
    This is basically wrapping variables/functions inside of another function
    to limit the scope of these variables and functions to a local scope.
● 4. Modularity: Here, you will set up local variables/functions using
    modules where these variables/functions are treated local to the modules
