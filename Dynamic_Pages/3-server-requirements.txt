SERVER REQUIREMENTS FOR DYNAMIC CONTENT
───────────────────────────────────────
1. Must Have:
   - Web server software (Node.js itself!)
   - Port listening (usually 3000/8080 in development)
   - Response handling logic

2. Node.js Special Features:
   • Event Loop - Handles multiple requests efficiently
   • NPM Packages - Add functionality (Express.js, etc.)
   • No separate compiler needed (unlike PHP)
