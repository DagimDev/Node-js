SYNCHRONOUS ARCHITECTURE
─────────────────────────
1. How It Works:
   - One thread = One request
   - Blocks during I/O (DB calls, etc.)
   - Like a waiter waiting for each dish to cook

2. Pros & Cons:
   ✅ Easier to code
   ❌ Wastes CPU cycles
   ❌ Scales poorly (needs more hardware)
   ❌ One failure can crash others

3. Frameworks:
   - ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails (default sync)
