HOW REMOTE REQUESTS WORK
------------------------
1. User enters URL (e.g., ofijan.com) â†’ Browser checks DNS.
2. DNS translates domain to IP (e.g., 63.245.215.20).
3. Browser sends HTTP request to server IP.
4. Server responds:
   - Static: Sends HTML/CSS/JS directly (200 OK).
   - Dynamic: Processes code first, then sends HTML.
5. Browser renders received files.
