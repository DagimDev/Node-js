STATIC VS DYNAMIC PAGES
-----------------------
Static Pages:
- Pre-written HTML/CSS/JS files on a server.
- Sent directly to browser on request.
- Content changes only when files are manually updated.

Dynamic Pages:
- Generated on-the-fly by server-side code (e.g., Node.js, PHP).
- Content changes based on user/time/location.
- Example: Show French version for users in France.
